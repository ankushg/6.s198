## What I learned:
I learned about how the Designer and Blocks modes work in AppInventor. The Designer is similar to the UI Builder in Eclipse in that you can easily edit the properties on the side panel, but does not give as fine grained control. It has many modules ranging from simple UI widgets to complex components such as accelerometer controls. Blocks mode is a really nice way of modeling interactions between items that were created in Designer mode, and allows for an easy introduction to creating mobile apps for people who do not already know Android programming.
