#A simple block (not-not)

Through creating the not-not block, I learned several things. I learned about the process by which blocks are created, namely:

* creating the Blockly Block definition
* creating the Scheme code to be interpreted
* writing the Yail Generator code
* adding strings and URLs to the messages file

I also learned about the not-not trick in Javascript in general :)


#Adding functionality to the ‘pick a random item list’ Block

Adding functionality to the 'pick a random item list' block was significantly more difficult than creating the not-not block. I learned how to create dropdowns in blocks and also a bit more about how coding in Scheme works (I hadn't touched scheme in a long time).

I also learned more about the structure of AppInventor and how Blockly, Scheme and Yail all interact with each other.
