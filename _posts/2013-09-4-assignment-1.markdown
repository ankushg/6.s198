# What I learned:
Through these exercises I learned about how AppInventor handles web APIs and allows the user to interact with JSON and CSV responses. I learned how to use the ListPicker element to present a list of items to a user (though it would be nicer if it could be a modal dialog) and that it's possible to make the ListPicker button invisible while still displaying the list to the user from the Blocks interface.

One thing that might be nice would be a quicker way of finding blocks without knowing which bucket they are in or having to read through every block. One such way might be a textbox that filters through blocks and allows you to enter things in a way that's almost like code.

I also learned that it's pretty darn cumbersome to run both the AppEngine server as well as the BuildServer whenever I need to use AppInventor -- maybe create a new Ant task that does both at the same time?
